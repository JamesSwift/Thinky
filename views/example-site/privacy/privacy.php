 <p>
	*Retention period after last use: After the last time you perform an action
	in your account, or we use your data to provide a service (such as when an
	item is returned under warranty), an internal timer counts down towards the
	deletion date. This period is normally one year, but for your convenience
	you can increase the period. For example, allowing us to hold your
	information longer means you won’t need to re-enter it the next time you
	create an order. It will also allow you to view your order history for longer. 
	You can decrease the period again at any point
	or delete your account if you wish, however we will retain your information
	for a minimum of one year after this to allow us to fulfill warranties and
	handle disputes.

<h1 >
	How your information is used
</h1>
 <p>
	We use your information to perform the tasks you ask us to, such as
	creating an order or checking if your order is ready. We may also

 <p>
	We never share or sell your information with others, except as required by
	law and as outlined below:
